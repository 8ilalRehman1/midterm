All explanations 
Please explain what was done, how it was done, and why it was done the way it was.
The toon shader was applied to the characters. it was applied with a toon ramp. it was done tp emphisize the enemy and the charecter in the scene. It also made the most sense to put the sahder on the characters to show the shadows. 
The colour grading is used to emphasize the winter evening skys, when the sun sets it leaves the sky with many different colours and these colours i wanted to portray in this assignment. 
blinn phong was used for the ice section of the level. Ice can be very shiny so i have decided to use blinnphong to make the ice in the level really stand out and since the lighting is above it really givesa  good effect in the scene
